# Fetal-Health-Prediction-ML-Project
Forecasting fetal health is a crucial aspect of prenatal care, enabling medical practitioners to closely monitor and evaluate the condition of unborn babies throughout pregnancy. Traditional methods like ultrasound imaging and fetal heart rate monitoring provide valuable information but lack predictive capabilities to foresee future health issues. With the advent of machine learning (ML), there has been significant research focused on creating predictive models that can analyze various indicators of fetal health to anticipate complications. These models use historical medical data to train algorithms, thereby providing healthcare providers with insights for early intervention and tailored care.

The primary objective of this project is to develop ML models for fetal health prediction by utilizing advanced algorithms to analyze a wide range of health indicators, including maternal health metrics, fetal biophysical profiles, genetic predispositions, and environmental influences. The development process involves several stages: data aggregation from medical records, preprocessing to clean and normalize the data, feature extraction to identify key predictive variables, and model training using algorithms like logistic regression and random forests. The performance of these models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Once deployed, these models can provide real-time health forecasts in clinical settings, enhancing the ability of healthcare professionals to monitor fetal well-being, identify high-risk pregnancies, and improve overall pregnancy outcomes.
